    "## Motivation\n",
    "1. In general, if a request is in FAMIS, we want to see how its predictor variables (such as month, type, subtype, crew, assigned to, priority, etc) affect its target variable — recorded status. 'Closed' status is what we want. Moreover, if a request is closed, we want to see:\n",
    "2. how its predictor variables affect its completion time (i.e., time from the date it was received in the system to the actual completion date). Completion time is the target variable here. This is important for students' satisfaction.\n",
    "3. whether the completion is before the deadline or completed late. Timeliness is the target variable here. The best case scenario is every closed request is completed before the deadline. \n",
    "4. Last but not least, after understanding how predictors affect target, we can use machine learning model to predict target from a testing data, given that the model is appropriate enough. This answers the type of questions like 'What would be the best guess of a FAMIS ticket status if the system received it in September, from Julian and its type is IS Building Access?'\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook can serve these goals by providing:\n",
    "- Data summary and overview\n",
    "- Relevant charts, plots and graphs\n",
    "- Codes that execute commands for further understanding a variable\n",
    "- Tables that summarize coefficients from regression models and their significance\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to our motivation, here are the three main analyses that we will run:\n",
    "- Status Insights\n",
    "- Completion Time Insights\n",
    "- Timeliness Insights (we won't check coefficients here)"

    "## Note\n",
    "- Multinomial Logistic Regression is the model we will use throughout this notebook, because target variables can have multiple outcomes.\n",
    "- For regression we will only focus on one predictor variable and one outcome at a time. \n",
    "- If more than one predictor variable is used, for simplicity we will not take into account interaction and correlation  between them (also known as \"multicollinearity\").\n",
    "- For machine learning we don't need to scale predictors because they are all categorical. For convenience we also keep all dummies rather than (n-1) dummies, this perfect multicollinearity doesn't hurt if our model has high training score and testing score. \n",
    "- The \"Status\" column is not very reliable, so we can only use the Status Insights part as a reference. \n",
    "- The \"Complete By\" column may be set by default, so the \"Budgeted Time\" column (a column we will calculate later) may also be default. Hence, we can only use the Timeliness Insights part as a reference.\n",
    "- The Complete Time Insights is perhaps the most useful analysis among the three.\n",
    "- For conceptual soundness of modelling and more mathematical justifications, see the FAMIS Report document. \n"

    "## Steps\n",
    "For data preparation, here are some recommended steps :\n",
    "1. Creating a column named \"Request ID\" that provides a unique identifier for each request\n",
    "2. Dropping non-value columns\n",
    "3. Creating \"Completion Time\" column (time between \"Date\" column and \"Act. Complete Date\" column)\n",
    "4. Creating \"Budgeted Time\" column (time between \"Date\" column and \"Complete By\" column)\n",
    "5. Dropping unnecessary column. Those columns are either too specific or too irrelevant to our goals\n",
    "6. Dropping duplicated or unnecessary rows\n",
    "\n",
    "For data analysis, here are the steps that we will perform:\n",
    "1. If the predictor and the target are both categorical, checking chi-squared contingency to see if the predictor variable is correlated with the target variable or not (i.e, whether a change in value of the predictor results in a change in value of the target) \n",
    "2. If the predictor is categorical and the target is numerical, drawing box plots to see if the predictor variable is correlated with the target variable or not (this also helps with data visualization compared to performing one-way ANOVA)\n",
    "3. Plugging in variables and extracting some preliminary results for better understanding data\n",
    "4. Implementing Multinomial Logistic Regression model to quantify the effect of each categorical value of the predictor on the target\n",
    "5. Interpreting the coeffcient results\n",
    "5. Applying machine learning to predict target from predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "For modelling, here are the steps:\n",
    "1. Appending a testing row (this will be used later in the machine learning part) and converting categorical predictors to dummies\n",
    "2. Using LabelEncoder to encode categorical outcomes to integer values\n",
    "3. Creating dictionaries to look up the outcomes\n",
    "4. Implementing the model and checking coefficients' significance"

One way of pulling out these p-values from logistic regression is to use the glm package in R, but it's tough to run multiple models in R at the same time. We will build a Python code for checking p-value in multinomial logistic regression model, and then test it with already built-in statistical package in Python to see if they're matched. The code is based on Wald test and matrix algebra."
